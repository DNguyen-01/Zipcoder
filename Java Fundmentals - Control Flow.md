# Java Fundmentals - Control Flow

### Control Flow:
	* Block Scope
	* Conditional Statements
	* Loops
	* Switch Statements

* Control Flow - Java, like any programming language, supports both conditional statements and loops to determine control flow
* Block Scope -Before learning control structures - block or compound statement consists of a Java statments. Blocks defined the scope of variables - blocks can be nested 
  * public static void main(String[] args) - Class scope
  * anything inside of {} - all scope within the method scope is valid.
  * You may not declare identically named variables that is in the outer scope

* Declaration brings the code forward 
	* When declaring the variable, be more specific to the situation instead of x or y, etc

* Conditional Statements - conditional statement 
	* if(condition) statement   
Negate - the false statement for printing w/ !

* if/else statement - else is not required to be coupled with if
	* **to use else clause**, it must be coupled with a prexisiting if clause 
	* **to use an if clause**, you do not need a pre-exisiting else clause

* if/else if statement - 
	* else clause (otherwise) cannot come before else if, and can only after the else if clause 

* While() clause - will run infinity unless conditioned otherwise

**Zen of Python** - good guidelines for good/bad coding
	* be explicitwith coding


* Integer = nothing vs. int = 0
	* enter your age code - practice writing it

	
* DeterminateForLoop - you can type out fori in Intellij

* Nested Loop - performs identically to a determinateWhileLoop

* Method Loops - columns and rows 
* Multiple Selections - The Switch Statement
	* need to be defined absolute not  && or <=
