# How to think like a Coder (Problem Solving)

* Important to internalize to be successful as a coder
	* study efficiently 
	* getting comfortable with looking at the uncomfortable

* Problem solving skills are almost unanimously the most important qualification that employers look for - Demostrating computational thinking or the ability to break down large, complex problems *hackerRank*
* **Why is problem solving Important?** 
	* Dive Right In... (not effective)
		* Try a solution
		* If that doesn't work try another one
		* Rinse, wash, repeat
	* Best ways to solve problem is: 
		* **Decomposition** - (composer example)
			* Taking a big problem, and breaking it down into smaller pieces, until each pieces becoming uninteresting (Make Dinner/ Login User examples - see recording*)
		* Understand the Problem
			* Know exactly what is being asked. - Asked questions until you know grasp the subject
			* How to know when you understand a problem? - Having the ability to explain it to anyone (rubber duck, dragon explaining)
				* **Verbalizing it**, you'll find that your grasp of the subject is not as strong.
				* **Richard Feynman** (Research him, read his philiosophy on explaining) - "If you can't explain something in simple terms, you don't understand it." 
			* Do you remember being stuck on a problem? - 
		* **Plan** 
			* Don't dive right into solving w/o a plan
			* Nothing can help you if you can't write down the xact steps
			* In coding this means don't start hacking straight away. To get a good plan, answer this question: 
				* "Given input x, what are the steps necessary to return output  Y?" 
			* In coding, Programmers have a great tool to help them with this .. //Comments//
		* **Divide**
			* Do not try to solve one big problem -You will cry
			* Break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve. Make them SIMPLE!! 
			* After solving every sub-problem, connect the dots
			* **This technique is the cornerstone of problem-solving. (read step again, if you must)
				* Each piece into its simplest form
		* **Compose**
			* Combine the smaller pieces into larger assemblies
			* A system is composed of a group of object which interact
			* Sub-Problems (What if i get stuck on the smaller problems?)
			* Take a deep breath, accept that you're stuck (it happens to everyone). *be inqisutive*
		* **Stuck?**
			* **Debug**: go thru steps by steps thru your solution - detach from the problem and try to view it from a different angle 
			* **Reasess**: Take a step back - *someties reassessing is starting anew - Delete everything and begin with a fresh set of eyes
			* **Research**: Google how other solved the problem 

* Practice - 
	* Play games, do problem solving tasks
* Simple Framework - (Bamboo and rope example)
	* Even with the simplest framework, it can be effective 
		* "All problems share similar patterns." - Someone
		* Reconginizing patterns in your code and in problems will assist you
	* "Cultivate problem solving skills. It Matters!"
*
